# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Module 7

## Overview of the Analysis
Pewlett Hackard is a large legacy company with a massive workforce. They have experienced decades of growth, and have experienced lower than normal employee turnover in that time. As their workforce ages, it is becoming more apparent that they are on the precipice of a "Silver Tsunami" of retirement decisions. This will negatively impact the company as positions will be emptied faster than they can be filled, made worse by the fact that their longest-tenured employees are the most likely to hold management positions or positions of unique skill. 

To find a way to evaluate the magnitude of the potential retiring pool of employees, we were provided six data files that presented data on employees, their titles, departments, birthdays, hire dates, salaries, position dates, and many additional data points. Data from these six data files was merged and analyzed using a unique employee ID number as a primary key (and utilizing department number to link this information to department names). The following is a diagram of the entity relationship diagram (ERD) noting the relationships between the six CSV files:

- **The objective of Deliverable 1 was to create a table that presents the present titles of employees likely to retire, as well as the counts for each of these titles.**
- **The objective of Deliverable 2 was to create a table of employees eligible to participate in a mentorship program.**

## Summary



## Summary
In summary, the removal of the standardized test scores for the Thomas High School 9th graders had a small, but noticeable, impact on the updated school district analysis. In particular, the removal of these scores caused a small decrease in the district's overall average math score, the percent of students passing the math portion of the test, the percent of students passing the reading portion of the test, as well as the percent of students who passed both portions of the test. Interestingly, the removal of the 9th grade scores from Thomas High School – a medium-sized charter school spending $630-$644 per year per student – had no impact on results for the district schools stratified by type, size, or per-student spend. Thomas High School's ranking as the second best school based on overall percent of students passing both the math and reading portions of the test was not changed by the removal of the 9th graders. The analysis demonstrated that 9th graders perform worse overall than 10th-12th graders. The removal of these students from Thomas High School likely inflates their results by eliminating their lowest scores. It would be interesting to compare the schools in the district if all 9th graders were removed to see how that impacts Thomas High School's ranking.
